Introduction

This Java application provides custom implementations of fundamental data structures including doubly linked lists, array lists, stacks, and queues. The goal of the assignment is to implement these data structures from scratch without using Java’s built-in collection framework. The project enforces strong object-oriented design principles and demonstrates understanding of internal data structure mechanics such as memory allocation, traversal, and manipulation.

Features:
Implements generic versions of the following data structures:
MyDLL – A custom doubly Linked List
MyArrayList – A custom resizable array list
MyStack – A stack using MyArrayList
MyQueue – A queue using MyDLL
MyDLLNode – Node implementation used by MyDLL

Custom Iterator support for all collections
Manual memory management logic (e.g., dynamic resizing)
Strong exception handling (e.g., NullPointerException, EmptyQueueException, EmptyStackException)
Fully documented with preconditions and postconditions
No use of Java’s ArrayList, LinkedList, or other Java Collection API classes

What the app does:
This project doesn’t have a GUI or main method since it’s more of a codebase that could be used inside other Java apps. Here's what each class does:

MyDLL - lets you add/remove/get elements from any index in a doubly linked list.
MyArrayList - resizable array that supports basic list functionality like add, remove, get, set, and contains.
MyQueue - adds elements at the back and removes from the front.
MyStack - adds/removes from the top of the stack, supports peek, search, etc.

How to run this application, you need to have a java 18 and Eclipsse IDE and then download and extract the provided ZIP file(Make sure to download it outside your workspace). Review and run unit tests or create a driver class to test the functionality of each structure. All code is located under the implementations/ and utilities/ packages.

This assignment is intended for testing, extension, and integration into a larger XML parser assignment.
